Dynamic programming is a design pattern to solve large problems by dividing it into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

### How do we resolve or store subproblems and subsolutions?

  * Subproblems are often slight variations of each other. 
  * Subsolutions are stored in some other data structure.

  In short, dynamic programming must have some sort of repetitive overlapping subproblems.

### What are some ways we implement dynamic programming?

  * Memoization
  * Tabulation
