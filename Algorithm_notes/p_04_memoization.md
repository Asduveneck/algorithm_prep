### Memoization

  What is memoization? It follows one paradigm of functional programming; 1-1 input to output ratio. Thus, we can store results of a function so we can use it later on. This way, if we hit a recursive case where we've already calculated that value, we don't have to duplicate our results again.

  We'll use memoization for recursion.

I'll be working out of `../Algorithms/explore_memoization.js` and comparing code here
