We use Binary Search Trees for our Binary Search algorithm (which requires a sorted array).
And because Binary Search trees are sorted already, we should be able to implement a search function quickly.

Trees are great at handling recursion, and because binary search is recursive, this binary search tree will make it easier to implement a binary search.
