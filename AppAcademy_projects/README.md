All of hese projects came from App Academy online. More specifically, they came from career quest.

I'm writing the code myself and will go through the solutions if I am stuck.

To run these projects on your own local machine, change into the project (ex: `cd recursion_project`)
```shell
# install project
npm install
# Run specs
npx mocha
```
